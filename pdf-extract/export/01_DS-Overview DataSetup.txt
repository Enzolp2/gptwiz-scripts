 1 Note on the Data Installer  
 
With the d evelopment of TDM next generation the installation process of the TDM software changed:  
The setup routine has been split. There is now a software setup, in the following named structure setup, and 
a data setup (Data Installer) . 
All changes/extensions for d ata modules are installed via the data setup, which always contains the latest 
data. From now on, you can import data independently  of your TDM software version or hotfix.   
 
1.1 Minimum Requirements  
This change applies to all TDM full versions from TDM next g eneration 2017.  
 
In the existing versions TDM V4.8 and TDM V4.7 the data are delivered separately  with the data installer  
from the below mentioned hotfix:  
 TDM V4.8: HF12  
 TDM V4.7: HF17  only for  T3D-Data module s 
 
 
Data modules require certain software versi ons or hotfixes. When performing the data setup, the minimum 
requirement is compared with the existing software version from the customer.  If the customer version does 
not meet the minimum requirements, this is shown in the summary (last screen before the installation 
process starts) and the update for this module is not carried out.

 1.2 The  new TDM Data C oncept  
Module c ategories  
The existing software modules of TDM were divided into 6 categories:  
 Program  module s 
 Basic data modules  
 Demo  data module s 
 Data and interface modules  
 T3D data module  
 Catalog modules  
Only the program modules are installed with the structure setup. The remaining five categories are data 
modules and are installed via the data setup.  
In the system information  (menu path : Help > Info rmation ) you will find all the information about the 
installed modules. The header area of the dialog also provides information about the currently installed  
hotfix.

 1.3 Execution of the Data-Update  
1.3.1 Basic data modules, cla ssification and interfaces  
Basic data as well as data and interface modules are automatically installed from the software version 2017 
upwards only for new installations.  
When you perform a data setup on an existing TDM installation, changes and extensions  in basic data 
modules are  first imported into database update tables in order to protect your existing basic data from 
unintentional changes.  
In specially designed update masks, you can view the differences between your existing data and the data 
availabl e through the data setup and, if desired, transfer them.  
Start the masks for basic data matching and to match the class / group structure  
 The masks for basic data matching are started from the menu path  Configuration  > 
Data Administr./Import > Basic Dat a Import . 
Currently, this concerns the following basic data areas, which are delivered with the 
basic data module bTDM.  
 Tool holder  
 Interfaces  
 Cutting grades  
 Cutting grade groups  
From the same menu node you start the mask for the comparison of the data of your 
tool classification (tool classes / group structure) that are delivered with the data 
modules CLGR (or CLB).  
 
Start the masks for matching of the interface modules  
During the data update of the interface modules new mappings, classes, groups and gra phics of the foreign 
system are imported.  
 This new data is also imported into database update tables so that your existing 
interface configuration is not changed.  
In the menu path  Configuration  >System Data  > System  Administration  > 
Interface Configurati on CAM-Systems  you will find the masks for the 
adjustment of the interface data.  
 
The TDM Data Installer is supplied with the document  "Dataversion Description.pdf". This file shows , which 
CAS number is part of a particular Data Installer version. In add ition, you will find in the installation package 
for each CAM interface (AME) a document with the detailed description of how a particular CAM interface 
enhancement or exte nsion can be activated in TDM.  
For further details on manual data matching, see the document “Data Update.pdf” or by calling the online help.  
Simply press the button F1 after opening the corresponding mask .

are assigned:  
 Base data TDM Fixture Management Module  bFIX 
 Base data FMM Facility and Maintenance Management  bFMM  
 Base data TDM Gauge and Calibration Control Module  bPMU  
 Base data TDM Base Module  bTDM  
 Base data TDM System Module  bTMS

Available data and interface modules  
Classifications  
 TDM class / group structure  CLGR  
 Standard classification  
 CLB 
Interface Modules  
 CAD/CAM Interface  (AME)    
 TDM 3D -Solid Converter    
 Interfaces to presetting devic es   
 Interfaces to Kardex, Megamat, …    
   
1.3.2 Demo data modules  
Demo data modules have the prefix "d", followed by the short name of the program module to which the 
data are assigned:  
Demo data  Planning level / system   dCLGR, dTDM, dTMS  
Demo data T DM Class and Group Structure   dT3D  
Demo data TDM Tool Crib Module   dLGM, dLGMCLGR

1.3.3 T3D data module s 
 From software version TDM4.8 HF12 and TDM4.7 HF17, all changes and extensions for the data and 
graphics generator modules are installed via a data setup. The hotfixes do not contain any data from 
the above  TDM version .

1.3.4 Catalog modules  
Catalogs can be installed for TDM2017 by setup. Each catalog has a separate setup.
